# Sprint Light Gate Timing System

This is a lightweight and accurate **light gate timing system** designed to measure sprint times by detecting when an athlete passes through infrared sensor gates.

Built with the **Arduino Nano ESP32**, **modulated infrared sensors**, and a custom **Android application**, the system communicates wirelessly using **ESP-NOW** and provides real-time timing results via Wi-Fi to a mobile app.

## Features

- 📡 **ESP-NOW Wireless Networking** between gate nodes and the central controller
- 📲 **Android App** to control timing, start/stop sessions, and view results
- 🔦 **Modulated Infrared Light Gates** for accurate, ambient light-resistant detection
- ⏱️ **Millisecond Timing Accuracy** for short sprints and reaction measurements
- 🔋 **Battery-Powered** for portable, field-ready operation
